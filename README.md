- The Mapollo Hospitals Dashboard is a Power BI project for monitoring and analyzing hospital data.  
- Data preprocessing was done in Excel, and SQL was used for querying and integration.  
- Key metrics include patient admissions, diagnosis trends, doctor feedback, and financial performance.  
- Visuals include line charts for trends, bar charts for diagnoses, pie charts for revenue, and scatter plots for doctor feedback.  
- Interactive features like slicers, drill-throughs, and tooltips enhance usability and exploration.  
- Calculated metrics, such as length of stay and net billing, provide detailed insights.  
- The dashboard supports healthcare decision-making with a focus on real-time data and clear visualizations.
